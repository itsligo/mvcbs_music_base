###Basic Template for MVC Bootstrap

Use this as a basic template for future MVC Applications. Boostrap has been installed. Typical next steps are to make Models either through LINQ2SQL or Entity Framework or manually for POCOs.

####Note:
A primitive _index.cshtml_ view is provided. You'll need to pass a model to this View if you want it to display items. So begin by creating some models and create/amend Views from the Controllers.
The \_layout.cshtml file is prepared and renders a basic dropdown menu and a _featured_ section.
